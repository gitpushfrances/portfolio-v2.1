          Hi! I'm <span class="highlight">John Frances Eder</span>, a passionate full-stack developer 
          based in Mercedes, Eastern Samar, Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in building scalable web and mobile applications using modern technologies 
          like <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Laravel</strong>, and <strong>Android</strong>. 
          My journey in tech began with a curiosity for how things work, which evolved into a 
          career focused on creating user-centered solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently working at <span class="highlight">Smart Inbox Technology</span>, I've contributed 
          to projects ranging from employee management systems to customer-facing web applications. 
          I thrive in Agile environments and love collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver 
          impactful features.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source 
          projects, or tinkering with IoT devices. I believe in continuous learning and staying ahead 
          of the curve in this ever-evolving tech landscape.
        </p>
